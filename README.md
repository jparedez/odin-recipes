This simple webpage I will be creating as part of The Odin Project.
In this project I will demonstrate my proficiency with HTML.
By the end of this project I would have set up my own GitHub repository and successfully used Git to keep track of changes. I would have demonstrated my ability to structure a webpage using HTML.

I would have done all of this by using what I have learned in The Odin Project without a step by step guide but rather from my own understanding of the process.
